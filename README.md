# Voice_To_Text_App


This mobile app was created as part of a mini thesis course for university using React Native with React Native CLI and React Native Voice library. With this app, users can record their voice and the app automatically translates it to text. Users can then save the text to their local storage, and it will appear in a section for notes. Users can view all their saved notes and delete the ones they no longer need. This app is useful for anyone who wants to quickly convert their voice memos to text notes, making it easier to organize and access information.


## Works both on Ios and Android;


if you would like to try the app, you need to build it by yourself on your local machine.
